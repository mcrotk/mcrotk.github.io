  We consider the problem of multiple subsystems, each with its own
  controller, such that the dynamics of each subsystem may affect
  those of other subsystems with some propagation delays, and the
  controllers may communicate with each other with some transmission
  delays.  We wish to synthesize controllers to minimize a closed-loop
  norm for the entire system. We show that if the transmission delays
  satisfy the triangle inequality, then the simple condition that the
  transmission delay between any two subsystems is less than the
  propagation delay between those subsystems allows for the optimal
  control problem to be recast as a convex optimization problem.
