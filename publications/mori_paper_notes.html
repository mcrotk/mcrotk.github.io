<p class="abstract">
This technical note proposes a convex characterization of the set of
   all stable closed-loop linear systems that are obtained from a
   given plant, which may be multidimensional, by interconnecting it
   in feedback with controllers that satisfy a certain pre-selected
   constraint. We take an approach that is particularly useful when a
   doubly-coprime factorization of the plant is difficult to obtain,
   and a stable stabilizing controller may not exist (the plant is not
   strongly-stabilizable) or when one may be difficult to find; most
   related work requires one of these. We adopt the so-called
   coordinate-free approach, which, unlike Youla's parametrization,
   does not rely on a doubly-coprime factorization of the plant. We
   show that if constraints which satisfy a condition called strong
   quadratic invariance (SQI) are imposed on the controllers then the
   set of all stable closed-loop multidimensional linear systems has a
   convex representation, and norm-optimal control problems can be
   cast in convex form. Although the SQI condition is in general
   slightly stronger than quadratic invariance (QI), which was
   developed in related work, they are equivalent for common classes
   of problems arising in decentralized control.
