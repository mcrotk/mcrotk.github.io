<p class="abstract">
Quadratic invariance is a condition which has been shown to allow for
optimal decentralized control problems to be cast as convex
optimization problems. The condition relates the constraints that
the decentralization imposes on the controller to the structure of
the plant. Recent work considered the problem of finding the closest
subset and superset of the decentralization constraint which are
quadratically invariant when the original problem is not. It was
shown that this can itself be cast as a convex problem for the case
where the controller is subject to delay constraints between
subsystems, but that this fails when we only consider sparsity
constraints on the controller. For that case, an algorithm was
developed that finds the closest superset in a fixed number of
steps, and it was shown to converge in n^2 iterations, where n is
the number of subsystems. This paper studies the algorithm further
and shows that it actually converges in log n iterations.
