<p class="abstract">
 A feedback interconnection consisting of two nonlinear
   systems is shown to be input-output stable when a "mixed"
   small gain and passivity assumption is placed on each
of the systems. The "mixed" small gain and passivity property
captures the well-known notions of passivity and small gain
associated with systems: the property can be appropriately reduced
to an input and output strictly passive system description;
or alternatively can be reduced to a description of a system with
small, finite gain. More importantly, the property captures a
concept of "blending" of the small gain and passivity ideas.
This concept of "blending" can be visualized, for example, by
considering linear time-invariant systems that exhibit passivetype
properties at, say low frequencies; and lose these passivetype
  properties but have small gain at high frequencies.
