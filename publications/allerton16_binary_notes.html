<p class="abstract">
We consider the problem of handling binary constraints in optimization
   problems. We review methods for solving binary quadratic programs
   (BQPs), such as the spectral method and semidefinite programming
   relaxations. We then discuss two new methods for handling these
   constraints. The first involves the introduction of an extra
   unconstrained variable along with the alternating direction
   method of multipliers (ADMM), which has now also appeared in
   other recent literature. This allows the effect of the binary
   variables to be decoupled when they are minimized over. The second
   involves rewarding the one-norm while restricting the
   infinity-norm,
   based on a reformulation of the original problem. The
   piecewise linearity of the negative penalty results in the problem
   being convex until it hits a critical point, at which point the
   parameters of this linear term can be changed. These two methods
   can be applied to any problems which are convex except for binary
   constraints. In addition to testing them on BQPs, we show the
   efficacy of these approaches on point segmentation and image
   segmentation problems.
