We consider the problem of constructing optimal sparse controllers.
It is known that a property called quadratic invariance of the
constraint set is important, and results in the constrained
minimum-norm problem being soluble via convex programming. We
provide an explicit method of computing $\Htwo$-optimal controllers
subject to quadratically invariant sparsity constraints, along with
a computational test for quadratic invariance. As a consequence, we
show that block diagonal constraints are never quadratically
invariant unless the plant is block diagonal as well.
