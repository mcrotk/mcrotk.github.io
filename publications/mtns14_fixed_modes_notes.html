<p class="abstract">
A seminal result in decentralized control is the development of fixed
  modes by Wang and Davison in 1973 - that plant modes which cannot be
  moved with a static decentralized controller cannot be moved by a
  dynamic one either, and that the other modes which can be moved can
  be shifted to any chosen location. These results were developed for
  perfectly decentralized, or block diagonal, information structure,
  where each control input may only depend on a single corresponding
  measurement. Furthermore, the results were claimed after a
  preliminary step was demonstrated, omitting a rigorous induction for
  each of these results, and the remaining task is nontrivial.
<BR><BR>
  In this paper, we consider fixed modes for arbitrary information
  structures, where certain control inputs may depend on some
  measurements but not others. We provide a comprehensive proof that
  the modes which cannot be altered by a static controller with the
  given structure cannot be moved by a dynamic one either, thus
  generalizing and solidifying the first part of Wang and Davison's
  result. A follow-up paper discusses the second part.

  We would recommend instead reading the full paper
  <a href="../publications/fm_journal_notes.html">"Constructive
  Stabilization and Pole Placement by Arbitrary Decentralized Architectures"</a>,
  which addresses both parts of the fixed mode results, as well as an
  algorithm,
  refining and generalizing
  the results and proofs from this paper and the follow-up paper.
