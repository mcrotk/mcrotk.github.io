<p class="abstract">
A negative feedback interconnection consisting of two causal,
  nonlinear systems is shown to be input-output stable when a "mixed"
  small gain and passivity assumption is placed on each of the
  systems. The "mixed" small gain and passivity property captures the
  well-known notions of passivity and small gain associated with
  systems: the property can be appropriately reduced to an input and
  output strictly passive system description; or alternatively, can be
  reduced to a description of a system with small gain. More
  importantly, the property captures the concept of a "blending" of
  the small gain and passivity ideas. This concept of "blending" can
  be visualized, for example, by considering linear time-invariant
  systems that exhibit passivity-type properties at, say, low
  frequencies; and lose these passivity-type properties but have small
  gain at high frequencies.
