<p class="abstract">
We consider the problem of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
   which is a non-convex optimization problem with many applications
   in machine learning, computer vision, and topic modeling. General
   existing methods for finding a solution to the problem include
   additive or multiplicative update rules for doing alternate
   minimizations and ADMM, which find a locally optimal point for
   NMF. We propose a new method for finding a solution of NMF which
   considers transformations of initial factors derived from the
   singular value decomposition (SVD). This problem is shown to be
   equivalent to the NMF problem in a sense, and is then restricted to
   optimize over the set of orthonormal matrices known as the Stiefel
   manifold. We then utilize a method developed for optimization over
   this manifold to find solutions to the NMF problem. Application to
   synthetic data shows that the method exhibits promising
   characteristics, as it outperforms some traditional methods both in
   terms of reconstruction error and running time. Using the solution
   of this restriction as a starting point for the broader problem
   shows a further rapid decline in the error.
