  <p class="abstract">
This paper considers the controllability of linear time-invariant
(LTI) systems with decentralized controllers. Whether an LTI system is
controllable (by LTI controllers) with respect to a given information
structure can be determined by testing for fixed modes, but this gives
a binary answer with no information about robustness. Measures have
been developed to further determine how far a system is from having a
fixed mode, but these involve intractable optimizations and have thus
not been applied to the large-scale systems for which they would be
able to provide valuable sensitivity information.

Recent work has addressed the decentralized assignability measure of
Vaz and Davison from 1988, or complex DFM radius, which captures the
smallest complex perturbation of the state-space matrices which would
result in a fixed mode. This involved a minimization over a particular
singular value of a matrix variable, as well as over the power set of
the subsystems. Scalable methods were developed to compute close upper
bounds for this metric, along with methods to compute lower bounds.

In this paper we address the more realistic and less conservative
measure of the smallest real perturbation of the state-space matrices
which results in a fixed mode, or real DFM radius, which was developed
by Lam and Davison. This involves two difficult minimizations similar
to the ones encountered for the complex DFM radius, along with a
non-concave maximization over an additional parameter. We adapt and apply the
tools developed previously while further addressing the maximization
difficulty, developing scalable methods of approximating the real DFM
radius, and further discussing methods of obtaining upper and lower bounds.
