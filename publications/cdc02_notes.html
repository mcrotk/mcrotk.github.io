<p class="abstract">

We consider the problem of constructing decentralized control
systems. We formulate this problem as one of minimizing the
closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to constraints on the
controller structure. We define the notion of quadratic invariance
of a constraint set with respect to a system, and show that if the
constraint set has this property, then the constrained minimum norm
problem may be solved via convex programming. We also show that
quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for the constraint
set to be preserved under feedback.
<BR><BR>
We develop necessary and sufficient conditions under which the
constraint set is quadratically invariant, and show that many
examples of decentralized synthesis which have been proven to be
solvable in the literature are quadratically invariant. As an
example, we show that a controller which minimizes the norm of the
closed-loop map may be efficiently computed in the case where
distributed controllers can communicate faster than the propagation
delay of the plant dynamics.
