Abstract
</h3 class="abstract">
<blockquote>
<p class="abstract">
Quadratic invariance is a condition which has been shown to allow for
optimal decentralized control problems to be cast as convex
optimization problems. The condition relates the constraints that the
decentralization imposes on the controller to the structure of the
plant.
In this paper, we consider the problem of
finding the closest subset and superset of the decentralization
constraint which are quadratically invariant when the original problem is not.
We show that this can itself be cast as a convex problem for the
case where the controller is subject to delay constraints between
subsystems, but that this fails when we only consider sparsity
constraints on the controller. For that case, we develop an
algorithm that finds the closest superset in a fixed number of steps,
and discuss methods of finding a close subset.

<p class="pnotes">
The numerical examples, as well as some of the discussion on finding
the closest set or subset for sparsity constraints, had to be cut to
meet the length requirements. Above is a link to the paper as it
appeared in TAC, as well as to a full version as posted on arXiv.
The full version is recommended.
