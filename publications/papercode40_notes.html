<p class="abstract">
We consider the problem of finding decentralized controllers to
  optimize an H<sub>&#8734</sub>-norm. This can be cast as a convex optimization
  problem when certain conditions are satisfied, but it is an
  infinite-dimensional problem that still cannot be addressed with
  existing methods. We use Q-parametrization to approach the original
  problem with a sequence of finite-dimensional problems. A method is
  discussed to solve the resulting finite-dimensional approximated
  convex problem. It is then shown how this problem can be cast as a
  semidefinite program and generally solved much more efficiently.
