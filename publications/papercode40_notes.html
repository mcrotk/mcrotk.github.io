<p class="abstract">
We consider the problem of finding decentralized controllers to
  optimize an H<sub>&#8734</sub>-norm. This can be cast as a convex optimization
  problem when certain conditions are satisfied, but it is an
  infinite-dimensional problem that still cannot be addressed with
  existing methods. We use Q-parametrization to approach the original
  problem with a sequence of finite-dimensional problems. A method is
  discussed to solve the resulting finite-dimensional approximated
  convex problem. It is then shown how this problem can be cast as a
  semidefinite program and generally solved much more efficiently.

The paper is given as it will appear in the proceedings aside from the
  page numbering.  It will be replaced with the official version when
  it becomes available.  A slightly extended version will likely be
  uploaded here and to arXiv shortly.
