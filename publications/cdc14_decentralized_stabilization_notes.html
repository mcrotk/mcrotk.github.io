<p class="abstract">
A seminal result in decentralized control is the development of fixed
  modes by Wang and Davison in 1973 - that plant modes which cannot be
  moved with a static decentralized controller cannot be moved by a
  dynamic one either, and that the other modes which can be moved can
  be shifted to any chosen location with arbitrary precision. These
  results were developed for perfectly decentralized, or block
  diagonal, information structure, where each control input may only
  depend on a single corresponding measurement. Furthermore, the
  results were claimed after a preliminary step was demonstrated,
  omitting a rigorous induction for each of these results, and the
  remaining task is nontrivial.
<BR><BR>
  In this paper, we consider fixed modes for arbitrary information
  structures, where certain control inputs may depend on some
  measurements but not others. We provide a comprehensive proof that
  the modes which can be altered by a static controller with the given
  structure can be moved by a dynamic one to any chosen location with
  arbitrary precision, thus generalizing and solidifying the second
  part of Wang and Davison's result. A previous paper discussed the
  first part.
<BR><BR>
  This shows that a system can be stabilized by a linear time-invariant
  controller with the given information structure as long as all of
  the modes which are fixed with respect to that structure are in the
  left half-plane; an algorithm for synthesizing such a stabilizing
  decentralized controller is then distilled from the proof.

  We would recommend instead reading the full paper
  <a href="../publications/fm_journal_notes.html">"Constructive
  Stabilization and Pole Placement by Arbitrary Decentralized Architectures"</a>,
  which addresses both parts of the fixed mode results, as well as the
  algorithm,
  refining and generalizing
  the results and proofs from this paper and the prior paper.
