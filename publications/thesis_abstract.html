    This thesis considers the problem of constructing optimal
    decentralized controllers.  The problem is formulated as one of
    minimizing the closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to
    constraints on the controller structure.  
<BR><BR>
The notion of
    quadratic invariance of a constraint set with respect to a system
    is defined.
It is shown that quadratic invariance is necessary
    and sufficient for the constraint set to be preserved under
    feedback.
    It is further shown that if the constraint set has this property, 
this allows the
    constrained minimum-norm problem to be solved via convex
    programming.   
These results are developed in a very general
    framework, and are shown to hold for continuous-time systems,
    discrete-time systems, or operators on Banach spaces, for stable
    or unstable plants, and for the minimization of any norm.

  The utility of these results is then demonstrated on some specific
  constraint classes.
An explicit test is derived for sparsity
  constraints on a controller to be quadratically invariant, 
  and thus amenable to  convex synthesis.
Symmetric synthesis is also shown to be quadratically invariant.

The problem of control over networks with delays is then addressed as another 
constraint class.
  Multiple subsystems are considered, each with its own
  controller, such that the dynamics of each subsystem may affect
  those of other subsystems with some propagation delays, and the
  controllers may communicate with each other with some transmission
  delays.
It is shown that 
if the communication delays are less than
  the propagation delays,
then the associated constraints are quadratically invariant,
and thus optimal controllers can be synthesized.
 We further show that this result still holds 
  in the presence of computational delays.

  This thesis
unifies the few previous results 
  on specific tractable decentralized control problems, 
identifies broad and useful classes of new solvable problems,
and delineates the largest
  known class of convex problems in decentralized control.
