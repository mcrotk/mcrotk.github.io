<p class="abstract">
This work considers the determination of non-binary measures of
controllability or robustness with respect to decentralized
controllers. A measure developed by Vaz and Davison in 1988 nicely
captures the distance from a plant to the closest one with a fixed
mode, and ties it to eigenvalue assignability; that is, how much
effort is at most required to move the modes a given amount with the
prescribed information structure. This metric is intractable to
compute, but recent work has been very successful in finding close
upper bounds. Finding lower bounds is not only important for providing
guarantees on where the true metric lies, but is typically more
important since determining whether the metric is bounded away from
zero corresponds to whether the system can be controlled at all. This
talk will address these lower bounds, in particular by using the
Courant-Fischer formulation of singular values, we will formulate our
problem as a polynomial optimization problem, for which we can then
use Sum-of-Squares (SOS) techniques to find a lower bound.
