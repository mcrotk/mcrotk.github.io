Quadratic invariance is a condition which has been shown to allow for
optimal decentralized control problems to be cast as convex
optimization problems. The condition relates the constraints that
the decentralization imposes on the controller to the structure of
the plant. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the
closest subset and superset of the decentralization constraint which
are quadratically invariant when the original problem is not. We
show that this can itself be cast as a convex problem for the case
where the controller is subject to delay constraints between
subsystems, but that this fails when we only consider sparsity
constraints on the controller. For that case, we develop an
algorithm that finds the closest superset in a fixed number of
steps, and discuss methods of finding a close subset.

In this paper, the algorithm for finding the closest quadratically
invariant superset was shown to converge within N^2 iterations,
where N is the number of subsystems.
This was later reduced to log_2(N). The proof for the improved bound
is given in the <a href="./papercode34_notes.html">subsequent
TAC paper</a>
and IFAC paper.
