<p class="abstract">

We consider the problem of multiple subsystems, each with its own
controller, such that the dynamics of each subsystem may affect
those of other subsystems with some propagation delays, and the
controllers may communicate with each other with some transmission
delays. We wish to synthesize controllers to minimize a closed-loop
norm for the entire system. We show that if the transmission delays
satisfy the triangle inequality, then the simple condition that the
transmission delay between any two subsystems is less than the
propagation delay between those subsystems allows for the optimal
control problem to be recast as a convex optimization problem.
This is shown to unify and broadly generalize the class of such
systems amenable to convex synthesis.
<BR><BR>
We develop analagous results for spatio-temporal systems, showing
that if transmission delays satisfy the triangle inequality, then the
transmission delay between any two points being less than the
propagation delay between those two points similarly allows the
optimal control problem to be cast as a convex optimization
problem. When considering the special case of spatially invariant
systems, this is shown to yield a simple characterization of which
of those problems are amenable to convex synthesis, which itself is
a broad generalization of such previously characterized convex problems.
