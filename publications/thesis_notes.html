This thesis considers the problem of constructing optimal
decentralized controllers. The problem is formulated as one of
minimizing the closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to
constraints on the controller structure.
<BR><BR>
The notion of
quadratic invariance of a constraint set with respect to a system
is defined.
It is shown that quadratic invariance is necessary
and sufficient for the constraint set to be preserved under
feedback.
It is further shown that if the constraint set has this property,
this allows the
constrained minimum-norm problem to be solved via convex
programming.
These results are developed in a very general
framework, and are shown to hold for continuous-time systems,
discrete-time systems, or operators on Banach spaces, for stable
or unstable plants, and for the minimization of any norm.
<BR><BR>
The utility of these results is then demonstrated on some specific
constraint classes.
An explicit test is derived for sparsity
constraints on a controller to be quadratically invariant,
and thus amenable to convex synthesis.
Symmetric synthesis is also shown to be quadratically invariant.
<BR><BR>
The problem of control over networks with delays is then addressed as another
constraint class.
Multiple subsystems are considered, each with its own
controller, such that the dynamics of each subsystem may affect
those of other subsystems with some propagation delays, and the
controllers may communicate with each other with some transmission
delays.
It is shown that
if the communication delays are less than
the propagation delays,
then the associated constraints are quadratically invariant,
and thus optimal controllers can be synthesized.
We further show that this result still holds
in the presence of computational delays.
<BR><BR>
This thesis
unifies the few previous results
on specific tractable decentralized control problems,
identifies broad and useful classes of new solvable problems,
and delineates the largest
known class of convex problems in decentralized control.
