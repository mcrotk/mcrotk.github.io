<p class="abstract">
We consider dual optimization problems to the fundamental problem of
finding the minimum distance from a point to a subspace. We provide a
counterexample to a theorem which has appeared in the literature,
relating the minimum distance problem to a maximization problem in the
predual space. The theorem was stated in a series of papers by Zames
and Owen in the early 1990s in conjunction with a non-standard
definition, which together are true, but the theorem is false when
assuming standard definitions, as it would later appear. Reasons for
the failure of this theorem are discussed; in particular, the fact
that the Hahn-Banach Theorem cannot be guaranteed to provide an
extension which is an element of the predual space. The condition
needed to restore the theorem is derived; namely, that the annihilator
of the pre-annihilator return the original subspace of interest. This
condition is consistent with the non-standard definition initially
used, and it is further shown to be necessary in a sense.
