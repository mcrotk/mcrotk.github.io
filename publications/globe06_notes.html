We consider the problem of multiple subsystems, each with its own
controller, such that the dynamics of each subsystem may affect those
of other subsystems with some propagation delays, and the controllers
may communicate with each other with some transmission delays. It was
recently shown, assuming linearity and time-invariance of the
subsystems and their controllers, that if the transmission delays
satisfy the triangle inequality, then the simple condition that the
transmission delay between any two subsystems is less than the
propagation delay between those subsystems allows for the optimal
control problem to be recast as a convex optimization problem. In this
paper it is shown that the same condition allows for parameterization
of all causal stabilizing decentralized controllers, even if the
subsystems or admissible controllers are nonlinear time-varying.
