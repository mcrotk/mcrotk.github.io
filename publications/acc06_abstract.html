The problem of parameterizing all stabilizing controllers subject to
constraints is considered.
A new condition relating the plant and the constraints is introduced,
and it is shown that when it holds, the constraints are invariant
under feedback.
<BR><BR>
There is no assumption of linearity or time-invariance on either the
plant or the admissible controllers, only causality.  There is also no
assumption that the constraint set be a subspace, only that it is
closed.  The results hold in continuous time or discrete time.
<BR><BR>
When the condition holds, we then obtain a parameterization of all
stabilizing controllers subject to the specified constraints, which is
a convex parameterization as long as the desired constraint set is convex.
