Certain types of satellite failures, such as broadcast ephemeris messages
that do not correspond to true satellite locations, can be difficult to
detect by a Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) ground facility (LGF)
because satellites are observed from reference antennas that are very
close together. Although ephemeris failures large enough to threaten LAAS
user integrity should be very rare, a combination of monitors in the LGF
is needed. This paper analyzes the combined effectiveness of several
monitoring techniques and proposes solutions for all phases of LAAS
operations. 
<BR><BR>
The first solution is the combination of the GPS Operational
Control Segment (OCS) and monitors included in the existing Category I LGF
prototypes. Built-in LGF checks confirm that broadcast range and
range-rate corrections have reasonable values and also compare computed
satellite positions based on the current and previous ephemeris messages
as well as the current almanac message. OCS monitoring by itself is
insufficient for LAAS because OCS alerts are not guaranteed to meet the
minimum time-to-alert requirement of 6 seconds for precision
approaches. However, the combination of OCS and existing LGF monitoring is
sufficient to meet the allocated per-approach probability of an undetected
ephemeris error for Category I operations. 
<BR><BR>
For Category II and III
operations, the integrity requirement is 200 times tighter than for
Category I; thus the monitors described above may be insufficient. This
paper introduces new algorithms for validating ephemerides in three
dimensions that can provide the needed improvement. The Differential
Pseudorange Residual method (DPR) is used to detect ephemeris errors
parallel to the LGF   satellite line of sight, and the Double Phase
Difference with Ambiguity Search method (DPDAS) is used to detect
ephemeris errors perpendicular to the line of sight (and thus very
difficult to observe). Unlike RAIM, these two methods need only
one other already-approved GPS satellite in view. These two methods can
detect all ephemeris failures in three
dimensions. This paper develops these algorithms in detail and presents
experimental results from the Stanford LAAS Integrity Monitor Testbed
(IMT).
