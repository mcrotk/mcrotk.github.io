<p class="abstract">
This paper discusses the controllability of linear time-invariant
   (LTI) systems with decentralized controllers. Whether an LTI system
   is controllable (by LTI controllers) with respect to a given
   information structure can be determined by testing for fixed modes,
   but this gives a binary answer with no information about
   robustness. Measures have been developed to further determine how
   far a system is from having a fixed mode, in particular the
   decentralized assignability measure of Vaz and Davison in 1988, but
   these measures cannot actually be computed in most cases. We thus
   seek an easily computable, non-binary measure of controllability
   for LTI systems with decentralized controllers of arbitrary
   information structure.

In this paper, we address this problem by utilizing modern
   optimization techniques to tackle the decentralized assignability
   measure. The main difficulties which have previously precluded its
   widespread use, are that it involves the minimization of the n-th
   singular value of a matrix, which must further be minimized over a
   power set of the subsystems. We will propose three methods to
   address its computation. First, we will discuss a relaxed convex
   problem, using the nuclear norm in place of the singular value, and
   expressing the power set minimization as binary constraints which
   can be relaxed to the hypercube. Our second algorithm simply
   entails rounding when the first method fails to reach a corner of
   the hypercube. Our final algorithm is developed using the
   Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), and is shown to
   decouple the effects of the binary variables, such that they can be
optimized directly with per-iteration computations scaling linearly,
rather than exponentially, with the number of subsystems. This final
method is shown to produce results which closely track the
assignability measure across a variety of fixed mode types.
