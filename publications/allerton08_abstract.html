  We consider the problem of spatio-temporal systems,
with sensor measurements and control actions at each point in a
spatial domain,
such that the dynamics at each point may effect those
at any other point with some propagation delay, and the controllers may
communicate between any points with some transmission delays.
 We wish to synthesize such a controller to minimize a closed-loop
  norm for the entire system. We show that, similar to results for
  finite subsystems, if the transmission delays
  satisfy the triangle inequality, then the simple condition that the
  transmission delay between any two points is less than the
  propagation delay between those points allows for the optimal
  control problem to be recast as a convex optimization problem.
  We can then view spatially invariant systems as a special case,
  and a broad  generalisation of the class of such
  systems amenable to convex synthesis quickly falls out. In
  particular, the class of systems determined by funnel causal
  propagation functions in one dimension can be generalised to those
  determined by subadditive propagation functions in arbitrary dimensions.
