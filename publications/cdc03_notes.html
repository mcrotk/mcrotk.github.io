We consider the problem of constructing decentralized control systems
for unstable plants. We formulate this problem as one of
minimizing the closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to
constraints on the controller structure, and explore which
problems are amenable to convex synthesis.
<BR><BR>
For stable systems, it is known that a property called quadratic
invariance of the constraint set is important. If the constraint
set is quadratically invariant, then the constrained minimum-norm
problem may be solved via convex programming. Examples where
constraints are quadratically invariant include many classes of
sparsity constraints, as well as symmetric constraints. In this
paper we extend this approach to the unstable case, allowing
convex synthesis of stabilizing controllers subject to
quadratically invariant constraints.
