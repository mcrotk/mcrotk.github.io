  We cast the problem of optimal decentralized control as one of
  minimizing a closed-loop norm subject to a subspace constraint on
  the controller.  In this note we consider 
   continuous linear operators on Banach spaces, and show that
  a simple property called quadratic invariance is
  necessary and sufficient for the constraint set to be preserved
  under feedback, and thus allows optimal synthesis to be recast as a
  convex optimization problem.  
  These results hold for any norm and any Banach space.
