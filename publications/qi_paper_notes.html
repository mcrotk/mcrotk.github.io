We consider the problem of constructing optimal decentralized
controllers. We formulate this problem as one of minimizing the
closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to constraints on the
controller structure. We define the notion of quadratic invariance
of a constraint set with respect to a system, and show that if the
constraint set has this property, then the constrained minimum-norm
problem may be solved via convex programming. We also show that
quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for the constraint
set to be preserved under feedback. These results are developed in
a very general framework, and are shown to hold in both continuous
and discrete time, for both stable and unstable systems, and for any
norm.
<BR><BR>
This notion unifies many previous results identifying specific
tractable decentralized control problems, and delineates the largest
known class of convex problems in decentralized control.
<BR><BR>
As an example, we show that optimal stabilizing controllers may be
efficiently computed in the case where distributed controllers can
communicate faster than their dynamics propagate. We also show that
symmetric synthesis is included in this classification, and provide
a test for sparsity constraints to be quadratically invariant, and
thus amenable to convex synthesis.
