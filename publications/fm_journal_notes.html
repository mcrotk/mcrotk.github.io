<p class="abstract">
A seminal result in decentralized control is the development of fixed
modes by Wang and Davison in 1973 - that plant modes which cannot be moved
with a static decentralized controller cannot be moved by a dynamic one
either, and that the other modes which can be moved can be shifted to any
chosen location with arbitrary precision. 
These results were developed for perfectly decentralized,
or block diagonal, information structure, where each control input may
only depend on a single corresponding measurement. Furthermore, the
results were claimed after a preliminary step was demonstrated, omitting a
rigorous induction for each of these results, and the remaining task is
nontrivial. 
<BR><BR>
In this paper, we consider fixed modes for arbitrary information
structures, where certain control inputs may depend on some measurements
but not others. We provide a comprehensive proof that 
the modes which cannot be altered by a static controller with the 
given structure cannot be moved by a dynamic one either,
and that the modes which can
be altered by a static controller with the given structure can be moved by
a dynamic one to any chosen location with arbitrary precision, 
thus generalizing and solidifying
Wang and Davison's results. 
<BR><BR>
This shows that a system can be stabilized by a linear time-invariant
controller with the given information structure as long as all of the
modes which are fixed with respect to that structure are in the left
half-plane; an algorithm for synthesizing such a stabilizing decentralized
controller is then distilled from the proof.
