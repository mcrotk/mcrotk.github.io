This paper discusses the controllability of linear time-invariant
   (LTI) systems with decentralized controllers. Whether an LTI system
   is controllable (by LTI controllers) with respect to a given
   information structure can be determined by testing for fixed modes,
   but this gives a binary answer with no information about
   robustness. Measures have been developed to further determine how
   far a system is from having a fixed mode, in particular the
   decentralized assignability measure of Vaz and Davison in 1988, but
   these measures cannot actually be computed in most cases. We thus
   seek an easily computable, non-binary measure of controllability
   for LTI systems with decentralized controllers of arbitrary
   information structure.

   This problem has been addressed by utilizing modern optimization
   techniques that tackle the decentralized assignability measure. The
   main difficulties which have previously precluded its widespread
   use, are that it involves the minimization of the n-th singular
   value of a matrix, which must further be minimized over a power set
   of the subsystems. A recently developed algorithm uses the nuclear
   norm in place of the singular value, then employs Alternating
   Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to decouple those variables
   that cause further non-convexity. In this paper, we aim to improve
   this algorithm by using its solution as a starting point for a
   tuning method that utilizes subgradient methods to directly target
   the n-th singular value, which is the original objective of the
   decentralized assignability measure.
