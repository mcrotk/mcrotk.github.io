We present a new framework, using a model-based bootstrap with
pre-whitening and post-blackening, to analyze the robustness of
overall controller synthesis methods to model uncertainties. This
considers both the system identification and the subsequent
controller synthesis together as an overall synthesis method to be
analyzed.  This framework is extremely flexible, can be used with
any identification or synthesis method, and can easily be extended
to many other types of problems. As a very encouraging first step,
we see a dramatic confirmation of the dangers associated with
certain synthesis methods.
