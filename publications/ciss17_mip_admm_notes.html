<p class="abstract">
We consider a class of mixed integer programs where the problem is
   convex except for a vector of discrete variables. Two methods
   based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) are
   presented. The first, which has appeared in the recent literature,
   duplicates the discrete variable, with one copy allowed to vary
   continuously. This results in a simple projection, or rounding, to
   determine the discrete variable at each iteration. We introduce an
   alternate method, whereby part of the objective is replaced by a
   new variable instead. When the objective satisfies a certain
   condition, this allows the update of the discrete variables to be
   handled separately for each one, thus maintaining linear complexity
   of this update, while incorporating some of the objective into the
   update. Initial comparisons on examples for which both methods are
   applicable show that the latter exhibits clear improvements in both
   performance and run-time.
