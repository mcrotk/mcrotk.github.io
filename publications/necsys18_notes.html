  <p class="abstract">
We address the problem of minimizing a particular singular
value of a matrix variable, neither the largest nor the smallest, 
which is then subject to some constraints.
This arises in the computation of the decentralized
fixed mode  (DFM) radius of a linear system, the distance from the system
to one which is not controllable, where it has emerged as
the lone remaining obstacle to tightly bounding the metric in a
scalable manner.

This paper formulates the problem with a difference of convex, or convex-concave,
formulation, writing the singular value as a difference of two Ky Fan
norms,
and then using semidefinite programming (SDP) representations of the
Ky Fan norm.
The main result provides an optimization problem for which the value
gives provable lower bounds on the singular value minimization problem, which is
convex if the original constraints are convex, and which is an SDP if
the original constraints are affine.
As the only existing nontrivial lower bounds were achieved by
formulating polynomial optimization (PO) problems and  employing sum-of-squares (SOS)
methods, this enables lower bounds to be computed for vastly larger
systems than was previously possible.
While developing methods for upper bounds had been far less
problematic,
this approach also produces several new methods for computing upper
bounds.
