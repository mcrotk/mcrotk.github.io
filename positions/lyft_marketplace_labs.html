    Mission Statement
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="pnotes">
      Marketplace Labs' mission is to firmly establish
      <a class="lyft"	href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a> as the
    global scientific and research leader in building and operating
    transportation marketplaces at scale, from rideshare to AVs to
    city-scale multimodal systems. Marketplace Labs accomplishes this
    objective by partnering with internal and external collaborators
      to bring the latest scientific knowledge to bear on
      <a class="lyft" href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>'s core
    technical and business challenges.

Roles
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p class="pnotes">
      Marketplace Labs serves three major roles:
      </p>
  <h3 class="lyft">
    Acceleration
  </h3>
      <p class="pnotes">
  Accelerating the work of other <a class="lyft" href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>
  research science and product groups by:
    <ul class="pnotes">
<li>Providing additional expertise, advice and collaboration on
  difficult science problems;</li>
<li>Serving as a swing resource to incubate new ideas and perform
  exploratory applied research to better understand and solve
  strategic problems and vet potential solutions;</li>
<li>Helping to coordinate and align the efforts of research science
  related to marketplace issues that cut across the company.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3 class="lyft">
    Incubation
  </h3>
  <p class="pnotes">
    Conducting our own research and thought leadership on strategic
  long-term challenges facing <a class="lyft" href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>,
    collaborating closely with
  existing marketplace science and product groups and (where
    appropriate) outside academic experts.
    </p>
    <h3 class="lyft">
    Outreach
    </h3>
      <p class="pnotes">
    Serving as a home for visiting scientists from academia and
    generally helping to facilitate interaction between <a class="lyft" href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>
    scientists and the academic research community. The aim of this
    interaction is to help inject new skills and knowledge into <a class="lyft" href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>
    research science, strengthen the <a class="lyft" href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a> brand throughout the
    scientific world, and share the great science work we do with
    external scientific colleagues, including participating in
    published research.

  Engagement</h2>
  <blockquote> 
<h3 class="lyft">
  Engagement philosophy</h3>

  <p class="pnotes">
Marketplace Labs' philosophy is to serve as a shared resource that
partners closely with other teams in <a class="lyft" href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>
who own the relevant problem areas.
<!--not as an isolated ivory tower tossing ideas over the wall.--
As such, Lab problem areas and projects are anchored on the core
strategic needs of <a class="lyft" href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>'s business, albeit not bound entirely by
today's issues and constraints. At the same time, by having an
exploratory, applied research mandate and a longer-term focus, the
Labs team can take on higher risk and more open-ended problems that
are difficult to address under the framework of existing,
execution-oriented teams.
</p>

<h3 class="lyft">
  Engagement methodology</h3>
  <p class="pnotes">
    The Labs engagement method consists of <!--two phases:--
    initial research and pilot development,
    with each phase involving the Labs team and the product-owner team.
  
    In the research phase,
    during which the project is largely undertaken by the Labs team,
    product-owner teams
    <!--embed members on the Labs team to--
    aid with exploratory research, ideation and prototype development.
    <!--The target time allocation is
approximately 80% Labs team time and 20% product-owner team time.--
If the research phase proves promising, the project moves to the pilot
development phase.--
<br><br>--
In the pilot development phase, during which the project is largely
undertaken by the product-owner teams,
members of the Lab team
<!--During this second phase, members of the Labs team embed on the
product-owner teams to--
assist in turning the prptotype into production. 
<!--The target time allocation in this second phase is
approximately 80% product-owner team time and 20% Labs team time.--
Once the product pilot is validated,
<!--the Labs team disengages, ----serving only--
members of the Labs team serve
as a consulting resource as needed for further problem solving and
enhancements.
<br><br>
This engagement methodology has multiple goals. The first is to ensure
that Labs project are rooted in product-owner team needs and also
benefit from their problem domain experience. It also ensures that
knowledge and innovations developed in the research phase are
transferred effectively to the project-owner teams in the development
phase. Lastly, it helps broaden the participation of <a class="lyft" href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a> research
scientists in the Labs work, so that all research scientists can
benefit from working on Labs research projects and learning from Labs
senior researchers.
