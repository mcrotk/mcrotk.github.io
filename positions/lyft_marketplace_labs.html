  <p class="pnotes">
    Over the last five years, <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a> 
  has grown dramatically from a small
  startup fiercely fighting for survival in the nascent ridesharing
  space to a major player in transportation tech anticipating the
  transition to becoming a public company.  It is approaching majority
  market share throughout North America, with a bold push into
  long-term bets like autonomous vehicles (AVs) and ambitions to be a
  key partner with cities in reinventing urban transportation.
    <br><br>
    Our current tactical, fast-iteration (sprint) approach to science
  development has served <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a> well getting us to this point, and
  continues to drive the core business today.  However, to be
  competitive against other tech giants in the transportation space
  and achieve our ambitious growth objectives over the long term, we
  also need to develop complementary strategic, long-run science
  capabilities. This is the purpose of Marketplace Labs.
