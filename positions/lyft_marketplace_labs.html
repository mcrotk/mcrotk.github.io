    Mission Statement
  </h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="pnotes">
      Marketplace Labs' mission is to firmly establish
      <a class="lyft"	href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a> as the
    global scientific and research leader in building and operating
    transportation marketplaces at scale, from rideshare to AVs to
    city-scale multimodal systems. Marketplace Labs accomplishes this
    objective by partnering with internal and external collaborators
      to bring the latest scientific knowledge to bear on
      <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a>'s core
    technical and business challenges.

Roles
</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p class="pnotes">
      Marketplace Labs serves three major roles:
      </p>
  <h3 class="lyft">
    Acceleration
  </h3>
      <p class="pnotes">
  Accelerating the work of other <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a>
  research science and product groups by:
    <ul class="pnotes">
<li>Providing additional expertise, advice and collaboration on
  difficult science problems;</li>
<li>Serving as a swing resource to incubate new ideas and perform
  exploratory applied research to better understand and solve
  strategic problems and vet potential solutions;</li>
<li>Helping to coordinate and align the efforts of research science
  related to marketplace issues that cut across the company.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3 class="lyft">
    Incubation
  </h3>
  <p class="pnotes">
    Conducting our own research and thought leadership on strategic
  long-term challenges facing <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a>,
    collaborating closely with
  existing marketplace science and product groups and (where
    appropriate) outside academic experts.
    </p>
    <h3 class="lyft">
    Outreach
    </h3>
      <p class="pnotes">
    Serving as a home for visiting scientists from academia and
    generally helping to facilitate interaction between <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a>
    scientists and the academic research community. The aim of this
    interaction is to help inject new skills and knowledge into <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a>
    research science, strengthen the <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a> brand throughout the
    scientific world, and share the great science work we do with
    external scientific colleagues, including participating in
    published research.

<h2 class="lyft">
  Engagement</h2>
  <blockquote> 
<h3 class="lyft">
  Engagement philosophy</h3>

  <p class="pnotes">
Marketplace Labs' philosophy is to serve as a shared resource that
partners closely with other teams in <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a> who own the relevant problem
areas, not as an isolated ivory tower tossing ideas over the wall. As
such, lab problem areas and projects are anchored on the core
strategic needs of <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a>'s business, albeit not bound entirely by
today's issues and constraints. At the same time, by having an
exploratory, applied research mandate and a longer-term focus, the
labs team can take on higher risk and more open-ended problems that
are difficult to address under the framework of existing,
execution-oriented teams.
</p>

<h3 class="lyft">
  Engagement methodology</h3>
  <p class="pnotes">
The labs engagement method consists of two phases: initial research
and pilot development. Each phase involves two teams, the labs team
and product-owner team. During the research phase, product-owner teams
embed members on the labs team to aid with exploratory research,
ideation and prototype development. The target time allocation is
approximately 80% labs team time and 20% product-owner team time. If
the research phase proves promising, the project moves to the pilot
development phase.
<br><br>
During this second phase, members of the labs team embed on the
product-owner teams to assist in turning the prototype into
production. The target time allocation in this second phase is
approximately 80% product-owner team time and 20% labs team time. Once
the product pilot is validated, the labs team disengages, serving only
as a consulting resource as needed for further problem solving and
enhancements.
<br><br>
This engagement methodology has multiple goals. The first is to ensure
that labs project are rooted in product-owner team needs and also
benefit from their problem domain experience. It also ensures that
knowledge and innovations developed in the research phase are
transferred effectively to the project-owner teams in the development
phase. Lastly, it helps broaden the participation of <a class="lyft" href="www.lyft.com">Lyft</a> research
scientists in the labs work, so that all research scientists can
benefit from working on labs research projects and learning from labs
senior researchers.
