<p class="abstract">
A sprinter is considered to have false started, not if s/he starts
prior to the firing of the starter's pistol, but if s/he starts within
0.1 seconds of its firing. Since this rule was implemented, runners
have indeed been disqualified for starting after the gun but prior to
this threshold, famously including a defending Olympic gold
medalist. The justification is that it would be extremely
unlikely or impossible for a human to react that quickly if s/he had
waited for the gun, but the likelihood of the alternative is never
considered. In this talk we consider the modeling of perceived
reaction times given that a false start occurred, and then compare the
likelihoods of false and fair starts for the range of times out of the
blocks. We then revisit this rule to discuss its fairness and possible
alternatives.
