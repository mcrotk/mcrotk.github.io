<p class="abstract">
Large-scale A/B/n testing often yields a Multiple Hypothesis Testing (MHT) problem with significant
dependencies. The dependencies typically cause the best-known methods to be overly conservative,
which often results in the multiple testing issues being ignored or being dealt with in ad-hoc
ways. The challenges of developing methods for MHT to be used across many different types of groups
in a company include being able to handle these arbitrary dependencies in a manner that doesn't
require knob-tuning and doesn't introduce excess conservatism, as well as maintaining rejection
regions which are easily understood (e.g., p-value thresholds). We discuss methods developed at Lyft
to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in such a manner. For the case where different subjects
can be considered independent (such as user-split tests) we introduce a bootstrap method to estimate
the false discoveries. For the case where no such assumption can be made (such as time-split tests),
we introduce a permutation method to estimate the false discoveries. The accuracy and robustness of
the methods are demonstrated on synthetic data, and if possible, demonstrated on actual rideshare
data.
