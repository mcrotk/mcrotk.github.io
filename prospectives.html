    Like at most U.S. universities, graduate admissions at UMD are
   handled at the department level.
   Please visit our department's admissions page here:
    <a href="http://www.ece.umd.edu/grad/admissions/">
      http://www.ece.umd.edu/grad/admissions/</a>.

    You may also wish to consider applying to the
    <a href="https://amsc.umd.edu/prospective-students.html/">AMSC</a> program.
<BR><BR>
    Please do contact me if you are interested in working
    together. Put "MAG19F:" at the beginning of the subject line if
    you're planning to start Fall 2019, "MAG20S:" if you're planning
to start Spring 2020, etc.
Please be clear about which program you're applying to (or considering
applying to), where you are now, and any other relevant logistics, as
well as your research interests.
<BR><BR>
I like to keep a small group of students who are highly motivated to
work on fundamental problems, and work with them closely.
